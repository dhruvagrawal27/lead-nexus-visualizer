## Backend: n8n Workflow
SamparkX uses an n8n workflow to fetch, clean, and enrich business leads. The workflow:
- Accepts POST requests at the webhook endpoint:  
  `https://dhruvthc.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/d728827d-2772-434f-aef7-68d5111b675f`
- Takes `industry` and `location` as input.
- Scrapes Google Maps and other sources for business data.
- Cleans and parses raw data using custom JavaScript and LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, Groq).
- Extracts and validates emails, phone numbers, and other details.
- Returns a JSON array of leads with fields:
  - `companyName`, `exactAddress`, `category`, `website`, `phoneNumber`, `emailAddress`, `rating`, `ratingCount`

**n8n Workflow Highlights:**
- Multi-step data cleaning and enrichment
- LLM-powered extraction and validation
- Handles noisy, irregular web data
- Returns clean, deduplicated leads

---

## Environment & Configuration
- No environment variables are required for the frontend.
- The backend webhook URL is hardcoded in the frontend fetch call (see `src/pages/LeadGeneration.tsx`).
- To use your own n8n instance, update the webhook URL in the code.
